When gunshots rang out on Durant Avenue and Telegraph Avenue in October of last year and law enforcement occupied the area, a mass email was sent to members of the UC Berkeley community, instructing them to avoid the area until further notice. Four hours later, another email that marked the area “all clear” was sent. The last email, sent another five hours later, informed the campus community that four individuals were shot, one killed and no students were involved in the incident.
