This year, more than 50 current and former Cal athletes competed in the Tokyo Olympics in a variety of sports, from swimming to rowing. These Bears entered the Games hoping to expand Cal’s all-time medal count of 207 Olympic medals, which include 117 gold. In addition to the athletes, several Cal coaches are headed to the Olympics, including Cal men’s swimming and diving head coach David Durden, who will be head coach of the U.S. men’s Olympic swim team.

This year’s Cal Olympic squad is slightly larger than the one five years ago in Rio, where the blue and gold sent 41 athletes and nine coaches and took home 21 medals in four different sports, 12 of which were gold. In London 2012, Cal’s most successful Olympics ever, the Bears won a total of 23 medals, 15 of which were gold.

Cal’s medal count per Olympics over time has had its ups and downs, with peaks in 1932, 1948, 1985 and 2012. However, the Bears have been on an upward trajectory since 1998. Cal has had the most success in water sports, with men’s and women’s swimming and men’s crew dominating the medal counts. Women’s water polo, women’s soccer and men’s track and field make up the next biggest sports to contribute to Cal’s medal counts.

The top seven Cal athletes with the most Olympic medals are all swimmers. Matt Biondi, Cal’s most decorated athlete, competed in three different Olympics, earning 11 Olympic medals, eight of which are gold.

The Bears have already won some medals in the first few days of these Olympic games. In the pool, Ryan Murphy won bronze in the 100 back, adding to his three medals from Rio and becoming the fourth Cal swimmer to win at least four Olympic medals.

“It was good,” Murphy said after his race. “That is the fastest backstroke field heat ever. To be a part of that, that was my best swim of the year, so it is nice to be able to do that in a pressure-packed final.”

Swimmer Abbey Weitzel also won bronze as a member of the 4x100 free relay, posting the fastest split of the field. Weitzel also competed in Rio, winning two medals there. Outside of the pool, Valerie Arioto won silver as a member of the American softball team in her Olympic debut. With many more events yet to come, the Bears hope to build on these medals and their previous success in the Olympics.
