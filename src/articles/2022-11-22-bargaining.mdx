Following a <a href="https://dailycal.org/2022/10/26/uc-berkeley-academic-workers-vote-on-uaw-strike-amid-bargaining-efforts" target="_blank">week of voting</a>, four bargaining units — which collectively represent over 40,000 academic student employees, academic researchers, postdocs and student researchers across the UC system — announced a <a href="https://www.dailycal.org/2022/11/02/uaw-votes-to-strike-following-historic-authorization-vote" target="_blank">historic authorization</a> to strike.

The systemwide strike began on Nov. 14, and is ongoing as of press time.
