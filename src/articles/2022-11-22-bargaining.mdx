_Editor's note: The projects department staff of The Daily Californian will update this article as contract negotiations between the UC and the bargaining units continue. All information regarding tentative agreements and contracts proposals is as of press time, which is listed for each bargaining unit._

Following a <a href="https://dailycal.org/2022/10/26/uc-berkeley-academic-workers-vote-on-uaw-strike-amid-bargaining-efforts" target="_blank">week of voting</a>, four bargaining units of UAW — which collectively represent more than 40,000 academic student employees, academic researchers, postdoctoral researchers and student researchers across the UC system — announced a <a href="https://www.dailycal.org/2022/11/02/uaw-votes-to-strike-following-historic-authorization-vote" target="_blank">historic authorization</a> to strike.

The systemwide strike began Nov. 14, and is ongoing as of press time.

In the months leading up to the strike, the UC system and each of the four bargaining units had engaged in separate contract negotiations. Each negotiation between the UC system and a bargaining unit consists of more than 20 articles concerning workplace policies for wages, layoffs, anti-bullying and much more.

While the UC system and the bargaining units have reached tentative agreements for many parts of their new contracts, negotiation continues for others. In light of this, bargaining teams and the UC system continue to set forth proposals for their contracts.

The negotiation processes also contain appendices and side letters — often clarifying the terms of other parts of a contract. Proposals and tentative agreements for appendices and side letters are included in this article.

As the UC system and the unions negotiate, they employ a variety of bargaining techniques. Often, parties will compile proposals into packages, where the bargaining teams have the opportunity to tentatively agree upon multiple articles at a time. Many of these proposal packages have allowed unions and the UC system to keep language from their current contracts.

However, the proposal history for some articles is less straightforward — with some having more than 15 proposals. Despite lengthy negotiations, parties have also moved to wipe entire portions of their contracts by withdrawing them.

This Daily Californian tool follows all four negotiations as they reach tentative agreements on parts of their contracts. It will link the history of proposals if parties have yet to come to an agreement. Otherwise, the tool will contain a link to the tentative agreement.

_The tool above does not list the complete history of proposals for negotiations that resulted in a tentative agreement. However, UAW bargaining units maintain Google Sheets that track contract bargaining for <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DKxtUSiKsNNtn8EFWkLgz6ZCXJ-slnh9stfNhGWS_hY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">ASEs</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1leiQPAGn6_e984Lkq67Se5xoUOT9C2UCVFPBtzsLQIs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">ARs</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FTrweuEBTZnLoIBhZdsYnw7oGzmD1sjgwNBzWQt52Eg/edit#gid=1264161244" target="_blank">postdocs</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TWjLH5KhLIZPeBEW3km8sL6TZY0-wec-n_SuHHF5PYw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">SRs</a>._
