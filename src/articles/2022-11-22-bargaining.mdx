_Editor’s note: The projects department staff of The Daily Californian will update this article as contract negotiations between the UC and the bargaining units continue. All information regarding tentative agreements and contracts proposals is as of press time, which is listed for each bargaining unit._

Following a <a href="https://dailycal.org/2022/10/26/uc-berkeley-academic-workers-vote-on-uaw-strike-amid-bargaining-efforts" target="_blank">week of voting</a>, four bargaining units — which collectively represent over 40,000 academic student employees, academic researchers, postdoctoral researchers and student researchers across the UC system — announced a <a href="https://www.dailycal.org/2022/11/02/uaw-votes-to-strike-following-historic-authorization-vote" target="_blank">historic authorization</a> to strike.

The systemwide strike began on Nov. 14, and is ongoing as of press time.

In the months leading up to the strike, the UC and each of the four bargaining units had engaged in separate contract negotiations. Each negotiation between the UC and a bargaining unit consists of over 20 articles concerning workplace policies for wages, layoffs, anti-bullying and much more.

While the UC and bargaining units have reached tentative agreements on the contracts for many articles, many are still being negotiated. In light of this, bargaining teams and the UC continue to set forth proposals for each article of the contract.

The negotiation processes also contain appendices and side letters – often clarifying the terms of articles. Proposals for appendices and side letters are included in this article.

As the UC and the unions negotiate, they employ a variety of bargaining techniques. Often, parties will compile proposals into packages, where the bargaining teams have the opportunity to tentatively agree upon multiple articles at a time. Many of these proposal packages have allowed unions and the UC to keep language from their current contracts.

However, the proposal history for some articles is less straightforward – with some having more than fifteen proposals.

The Daily Californian tool below introduces the articles from all four contract negotiations, details the history of proposals between parties and states whether a tentative agreement has been reached.
