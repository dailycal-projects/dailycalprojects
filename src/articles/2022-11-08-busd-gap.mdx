In 1968, Berkeley Unified School District, or BUSD, was the first in the United States to implement a busing plan to racially integrate its schools. Today, score disparities between BUSD’s Black and white students in statewide standardized tests are among the largest in California.

California students from third through eighth grades and eleventh grade took the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments, or SBA, in spring 2022. In October 2022, the California Department of Education released English language arts, or ELA, and math SBA score data for districts across the state.

In the 2022 SBA in ELA and math, Black students in BUSD, on average, fell far behind their white counterparts across grade levels. The achievement gaps in math and ELA are the fourth and fifth highest in the state, a Daily Californian analysis of California Department of Education data found.

_The charts above show the five California school districts with the largest score gaps between Black and white students in English language arts and math across all grade levels._

_The statewide Smarter Balanced Assessment has four main achievement levels for its assessments in ELA and math: “standard not met,” “standard nearly met,” “standard met” and “standard exceeded.” The data above reflect the percent of students for which the state’s standard was met or exceeded._

_Data for some student groups at some school districts were not available, and thus were not included in this Daily Californian analysis. Data are from the <a href="https://caaspp-elpac.ets.org/caaspp/ResearchFileListSB?ps=true&lstTestYear=2022&lstTestType=B&lstCounty=00&lstDistrict=00000" target="_blank">California Department of Education</a>._

In math assessments, 18.73% of BUSD’s Black students met or exceeded the state standard. In contrast, 74.07% of BUSD’s white students met or exceeded the standard. This 55.34% disparity was the fourth largest among California districts and the largest in Alameda County school districts.

84.03% of white students, but only 30% of Black students, in BUSD met or exceeded the state standard in English language arts assessments. This 53.04% gap was the fifth largest in the state, but not the largest in Alameda County, as the nearby Oakland Unified School District’s gap in ELA scores was the third highest in the state.

The Oct. 26 Berkeley school board meeting addressed this disparity in scores between Black and white students in a presentation by district administrators.

The presentation also pointed to other disparities within the district. While 58% of BUSD graduates are eligible to apply to UC and CSU schools, only 23% of Black students and 47% of Latine students are eligible to apply. Furthermore, 45.4% of houseless students and 26.9% of Black students missed at least a tenth of the academic year, according to the presentation.

Compared to white and Asian students, sense of belonging also suffers among Black and Latine students in higher grade levels, according to the California Healthy Kids Survey. 67% and 61% of BUSD’s Asian and white eleventh graders felt connected to their school. Meanwhile, only 43% and 47% of Black and Latine students felt connected to their BUSD school.

However, the fact that BUSD’s score gaps between Black and white students tower above most other California school districts was not shared during the meeting.

“It’s one thing to look at these broad patterns and trends. You can look at grade level performance. You can look at subgroups.” said BUSD Director of Research, Evaluation and Assessment Ruth Steele Brown. “But, at the end of the day you have to find each kid, and you have to understand why each child is performing a certain way.”

In turn, BUSD staff and school board members discussed existing programs that aim to improve instruction and rectify inequities in student belonging and achievement. Response to Instruction and Intervention, the Umoja program and the African American Success Framework were among those mentioned.

However, Berkeley school board president Ka’Dijah Brown saw the data as a call to revamp the district's existing approaches – and potentially pursue new intervention tactics.

“We are in crisis,” said Brown. “Time and time again we talk about this achievement gap, and this is the achievement gap right here in front of our eyes.”

In response to Brown’s concerns about chronically absent students, BUSD superintendent Enikia Ford Morthel claimed that plans to increase educators’ and principals' access to student data would help inform more individualized interventions.

With regard to the other disparities revealed by the data, Ford Morthel agreed that BUSD is facing a crisis. Ford Morthel added that more discussion is due to help close these racial and socioeconomic gaps between students.

“I’m really feeling like Fannie Lou Hamer,” said school board vice president Laura Babitt. “Just tired of being tired of looking at this data and hearing the same conversations repeatedly, specifically in BUSD.”
