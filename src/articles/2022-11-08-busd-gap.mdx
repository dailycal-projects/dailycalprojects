In 1968, Berkeley Unified School District, or BUSD, was the first in the United States to implement a busing plan to racially integrate its schools. That same year, Berkeley High School created its African-American Studies Department, the first of its kind in the nation.

Today, BUSD’s score disparities between Black and white students in statewide standardized tests are some of the largest in California.

California students from third through eighth grades and eleventh grade took the Smarter Balanced Assessments in English language arts, or ELA, and math in spring 2022. In October 2022, the California Department of Education released score data for counties, districts and schools across the state.

In the 2022 Smarter Balanced Assessments in ELA and math, Black students in BUSD, on average, fell far behind their white counterparts across grade levels. The achievement gaps in math and ELA are the fourth and fifth highest in the state, respectively, according to data from California Department of Education.

_The charts above show the five California school districts with the largest score gaps between Black and white students in English language arts and math across all grade levels._

_The statewide Smarter Balanced Assessment has four main achievement levels for its assessments in English language arts and math: “standard not met,” “standard nearly met,” “standard met” and “standard exceeded.” The data above show the percentage of students for which the state’s standard was met or exceeded._

_Data for some school districts were not available, and thus could not be included in this Daily Californian analysis. Data are from the <a href="https://caaspp-elpac.ets.org/caaspp/ResearchFileListSB?ps=true&lstTestYear=2022&lstTestType=B&lstCounty=00&lstDistrict=00000" target="_blank">California Department of Education</a>._

_This is the first article of a Daily Californian series on achievement and sense of belonging in Berkeley Unified School District._
