With hundreds of program listings over six continents, Berkeley Study Abroad boasts a variety of opportunities for students.

_The map above plots Berkeley Study Abroad destinations. Each dot represents one national destination, and its size represents the number of programs there. Virtual programs and programs within the U.S. are omitted. Data come from the Berkeley Study Abroad [website](https://studyabroad.berkeley.edu/explore)._

<br />

While programs seem to be clustered within western Europe, Berkeley Study Abroad reaches far in both distance and topic. STEM Research in Osaka, Human Rights and Cultural Memory in Santiago and Advanced Arabic Language in Amman are also within a UC Berkeley studentâ€™s range of options.

However, not every program is currently up-for-grabs. Mediterranean Nutrition and Food Systems in Greece is full for 2022, and Berkeley Global Internships in Tokyo, Dublin and Prague are canceled for 2022.
