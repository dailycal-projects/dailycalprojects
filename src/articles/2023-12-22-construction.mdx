Despite Berkeley's overall housing boom, the city's supply of affordable housing lags behind the quotas set by California's Regional Housing Needs Allocation, or RHNA, process.

The RHNA occurs every eight years, after which each local jurisdiction is recommended a housing quota from the state in order to provide adequate housing at different affordability levels.

For the 2023 to 2031 period, the RHNA mandates that Berkeley provide 2,446 units for “very low income” housing, 1,408 units for “low income” housing and 1,416 units for “moderate income” housing. These quotas reflect a marked increase from the 2015-2023 RHNA.
