Despite Berkeley’s overall housing boom, the city’s supply of affordable housing lags behind the quotas set by California’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation, or RHNA, process.

The RHNA occurs every eight years, after which each local jurisdiction is recommended a housing quota from the state in order to provide adequate housing at different affordability levels.

For the 2023 to 2031 period, the RHNA mandates that Berkeley provide 2,446 units for “very low income” housing, 1,408 units for “low income” housing and 1,416 units for “moderate income” housing. These quotas reflect a marked increase from the 2015-2023 RHNA.

_In California, 'Very Low Income' and ‘Low Income’ housing levels, as outlined in the Health and Safety Code, are based on a percentage of the area median income adjusted for family size._

These numbers reflect an effort to address the Bay Area’s displacement and homelessness crisis, according to a Berkeley Municipal Code update in February 2023.

Introduced in 1916, Berkeley’s single-family zoning laws contributed to Berkeley’s housing issues. These laws made it illegal to build anything but a single-family housing unit on a single lot. This restriction, according to a 2020 study by the Othering & Belonging Institute, further reduced housing options by limiting the number of people who could live in a given unit. With reduced availability of multifamily housing units, low income families lacked affordable options.

After the Berkeley City Council voted to eliminate single-family zoning in 2021, there has been a spike in the rate of housing projects approved by the city, according to a Daily Cal analysis of data from the California Department of Housing and Community Development.

Before the elimination of single-family zoning in 2019, 3% of the 363 total housing units permitted by the city were affordable housing units. In 2022, after the elimination of single-family zoning, 877 total housing units were permitted by the city, of which 16% were affordable housing units.

At this time, no construction permit for any housing development project in Berkeley can be issued unless at least 20% of the residential units proposed are affordable to residents in the “Very Low Income” or “Low Income” brackets.

Despite these regulations, affordable housing units constitute a small percentage of the overall housing projects in Berkeley. In fact, about 83.5% of permits issued by the city in 2022 were for housing that targeted renters with income levels above the region’s median.

Of the 379 permits approved from 2019 to 2022, 14 were commercial, 20 were mixed-use, and 345 were for residential projects, of which seven were affordable housing.

The seven affordable housing units all received funding from Berkeley’s Measure O, which was approved in 2018. This measure instantiated a bond that allocated $135 million for affordable housing projects spanning multiple years and added an additional round of $17 million in bonds in Oct. 2022. As of Oct. 7, 2022, $111 million of that $135 million has been used in completed or ongoing projects.

Typically, such affordable housing projects are made possible through funding provided to the renters from sources like Section 8 vouchers or to the homeowners via subsidies. Subsidies can come from various levels of government, from city, state, or federal. Berkeley consolidates all these subsidies, including its own Measure O, in what it calls the Housing Trust Fund.

Of the projects carried out by Capital Projects, seven received funding for affordable housing, while the majority received funding for infrastructure and transportation bonds.

Two notable Measure O projects completed in 2022 were the Jordan Court and Berkeley Way apartments. The Jordan Court project opened in North Berkeley during the spring of 2022 and used $3.5 million of Measure O funding to build 34 affordable studio units for low-income seniors. The Berkeley Way project in Downtown Berkeley utilized $13.8 million of Measure O funding to provide 89 affordable housing units, 44 beds for homeless individuals and 53 apartments for those with special needs.

Additionally, three Measure O projects in South and West Berkeley are currently under construction and will direct $29.5 million toward 204 units of affordable housing.

While current affordable housing availability is lagging behind the RHNA rates set by the state, 16 more Measure O projects are either in the pre-development or construction phases.

In addition, Berkeley's 2012 Downtown Area Plan, the guiding document for development in the area, aims to ”Cultivate Downtown as an attractive residential neighborhood with a range of housing opportunities, and an emphasis on affordable housing and family housing.”

Berkeley City Council passed reforms on November 22 that could lead to an additional 2650 housing units built in South Berkeley. These reforms include changes to building height caps and minimum density requirements that could create more high-density housing opportunities in Berkeley.
