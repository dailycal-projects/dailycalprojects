According to the National Park Service, UC Berkeley’s Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology, or the Hearst Museum, has the largest collection of Native American cultural remains in the country with over 9,000 ancestors and over 113,000 cultural objects.

While UC Berkeley’s history is dotted with social justice movements and activism, the Hearst Museum’s custody of thousands of cultural artifacts and human remains may tell a different story.

The encouragement of grave robbings, a belief in salvage anthropology by campus anthropologists, a slew of Bay Area Native American tribes not being federally recognized, and an interest in using objects and human remains for research opportunities are among the factors that built UC Berkeley’s notable collection.

The bar chart above visualizes the total number of artifacts UC Davis, UCLA and UC Berkeley hold in their collections, according to where the artifact was initially found. This number includes both cultural items as well as human remains, acquired by unearthing gravesites.

According to the data, UC Berkeley has the largest collection among these three UC campuses with UC Davis following far behind. UCLA, however, has only one artifact left in its possession.

The drastic differences between each school is exemplary of the processes and efficiency of each university’s respective repatriation efforts.

The original 1990 [Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nagpra/index.htm), or NAGPRA, constituted the protection and preservation of Native American gravesites and required institutions in possession of human remains or cultural objects to begin the process of repatriation. This policy required each institution in possession of Native American artifacts to compile a written inventory then to return the artifacts and ancestors to representatives of the tribes from which they originate.

However, not all repatriation processes were made equally. Data collected by the California state auditor in 2020 indicates that UC Berkeley failed to comply with the requirements of the original NAGPRA policy.

According to a California State audit published in 2019, UC Berkeley’s “overly cautious” repatriation process was the main driving force that hindered the return of thousands of cultural items. In comparison to UCLA and UC Davis who were able to process claims faster, UC Berkeley’s request for additional evidence of tribes submitting repatriation claims undermined the existing oral history and traditions that were used as evidence in the initial claim.

The audit also revealed that UC Berkeley did not have sufficient Native American representation on their Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, or NAGPRA, committee, which handles repatriation claims made by Native American tribes and returns cultural items and ancestors.

According to the state law [CalNAGPRA](https://nahc.ca.gov/calnagpra/), the committee should have at least three campus officials and three tribal members, two of which should be from a federally recognized California tribe and one from a California tribe that is not federally recognized.

In 2019, UC Berkeley’s NAGPRA committee failed to meet these guidelines; there were no members from a California tribe not affiliated with the university nor any tribe members that were from a California tribe that is not federally recognized. In response to the audit, UC Berkeley has since updated their committee and now meet the guidelines that are outlined in CalNAGPRA, which was passed with the intent to remedy the inadequacies within the original NAGPRA policies.

The state auditor also concluded in a June 2020 [report](https://www.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2019-047.pdf) to the California Governor that “The University of California is not adequately overseeing its return of Native American remains and artifacts.” This claim is backed by the thousands of artifacts that UC Berkeley still holds in its collections, compared to other UC schools which have repatriated the vast majority of artifacts in their possession.

With hopes of changing the bleakness of the UC’s repatriation process, a new [policy](https://nahc.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Final-UC-NAGPRA-Policy.pdf) was introduced in 2021 for organizations controlled by the Regents of the University of California.

Sabrina Agarwal, the Chair of the UC Berkeley Implementation Committee, provided more insight into UC Berkeley’s repatriation processes and history. In an email interview, Agarwal stated that the goal of the UC Berkeley Implementation Committee is to “review claims and make recommendations/decisions on claims for the Chancellor and also make recommendations on all NAGPRA related policy on campus.”

When asked about the changes made following the new 2021 UC policy, Agarwal said that “NAGPRA is now a tribally led process with a clearly stated goal of repatriation.” Making significant efforts to remedy past mistakes, Sabrina also states in the interview that she now finds that the committee has a “real partnership to repatriate holdings on the campus with the guidance of the Native American Heritage Commission and California Native American Tribes.”

Aside from underrepresentation of Native peoples in the NAGPRA committee, other setbacks and context for UC Berkeley’s repatriation process exist.

Lauren Kroiz, faculty director of the Hearst Museum, points out UC Berkeley’s history as a factor in campus’ hefty collection as well.

“Berkeley’s the oldest campus in the UC system. I think folks at Berkeley, we think about that, and we’re very proud, but at the same time, we can refer to it as the colonial core of the UC,” said Kroiz. She continued saying that while other campuses started amassing artifacts and ancestors in the 1940s and 1950s, the Hearst Museum started as early as the 1870s.

Moreover, she states that “a lot of tribes in the Bay Area are not federally recognized, because of how early colonization happened here,” and explains that lack of federal recognition makes the process of repatriation much more difficult.

When asked why UC Berkeley has failed to meet the requirements of the NAGPRA policy, Kroiz responded that UC Berkeley has held the greatest amount of artifacts in comparison to other universities in the UC system since the beginning. She also revealed that those who collected the artifacts and remains operated under the assumption that Native peoples would all eventually “die out,” and, therefore, their remains and objects should be preserved by California’s new European inhabitants.

Kroiz also explained that moving forward, UC Berkeley does not intend to conduct any research on Native artifacts or belongings without “the expressed interest of Native Tribes.”

Despite their efforts to progress in their process of repatriation, a key fact remains: UC Berkeley possesses more cultural belongings and human remains than any other organization on the NPS’ database, let alone any other UC campus.

Until every artifact and ancestor has been returned to its respective community, UC Berkeley’s repatriation will remain incomplete.
