The opioid crisis has had itsin its impact in the Bay Area since the pandemic, and illegal use of the drugs has caused reason for enhanced harm reduction strategies, specifically in UC Berkeley’s campus safety programs.

Opioids are prescribed as medication for severe pain, usually from intense surgery. Illegal use of opioids has been a continuous problem since the 1960s. According to the CDC, three significant waves of overdose have been attributed to: an increase in overall prescription in the 1990s, a spike in heroin use in 2010 and the introduction of synthetic opioids in 2013.

One of the most common ways that fentanyl overdoses happen is when other substances are mixed with or laced by it. Even ingesting a small amount of fentanyl is deadly. The mixture of fentanyl and other recreational drugs, such as alcohol, results in many overdoses going unreported, as many victims are unsuspecting users.

Since the pandemic, fentanyl-related overdose rates in Alameda County have skyrocketed, despite rates historically staying lower than the rest of California. Based on preliminary data for 2023, the county’s overdose rate will top that of the state as a whole by the end of the year.

The recent spike in overdoses related to the pandemic alludes to a new set of current issues. A 2021 study attributed this recent increase to the loss and lack of medical insurance and other financial burdens.

Furthermore, unequal access to health insurance —, especially among marginalized groups —s, pushes those that are disadvantaged to seek alternative medication forms, such as opioids. This can be understood through the overdose increase during the pandemic, when the medical care equity gap furthered , and opioids were increasingly used as under-the-table, ulterior forms of medication. Opioids are a type of drug that derives, or mimics, the opium from a poppy plant. The most common types of opioids include morphine, heroin, codeine, oxycodone and fentanyl.

In data from 2022, 0.3 percent of UC Berkeley students reported having used opioids in the past 3 months, compared to 0.7 percent of students nationwide. That amounts to about 100 students on Campus.

A study on Facebook was conducted in order to determine attitudes and beliefs that connect the increasing rate of prescription drug misuse among college-aged students. Recreation and self-medication, primarily against anxiety and depression, were the two most prevalent motivations for opioid use among young adults. The increasingly significant presence of drugs among college-aged students elicits immediate action towards prevention.

Because of the severity of opioids and the harm to their users, harm reduction strategies are important to implement before the consequences are present. Fentanyl test strips are critical to preventing, rather than reversing, overdoses. The strips are designed to test the presence of fentanyl in any kind of drug. With a standard kit, users just mix the suspected drug with water and dip the strip in for 15 seconds. A positive fentanyl result is indicated with a singular pink line and negative with double.

When someone overdoses from opioids, there are strategies in place that can be life-saving in these situations. Narcan (the brand name for naloxone) is the most well-known approach to overdose reversal, acting as blocks to the effects of the opioid on the body.

There are several sites on campus that provide free fentanyl test strips, and several clubs distribute them as well. FentCheck, a non-profit organization operating on the West and East coasts, distributes free test strips to bars, clubs and schools across the East Bay. Similarly End Overdose is a nationwide club with a chapter at Cal that focuses on preventing and ending overdoses.

Community organizations in the East Bay such as NEED and the Berkeley Free Clinic offer harm prevention resources. From 2021–-2023, both organizations collectively distributed around 4000 overdose prevention kits, according to the City’s Biennial Syringe Services Report. These resources helped reverse 415 overdoses, according to reports of who had used the naloxone they distributed.

The University is working towards preventing the harms of opioids on campus. The Harm Reduction Expansion Project (HREP) is a student-led campus program specializing in fentanyl harm reduction on campus. The program was founded in 2021 by four UC Berkeley Students, and works in close collaboration with PartySafe@Cal, campus’ main drug and alcohol abuse prevention program.

In 2023, the program received an $18,215 grant from the Berkeley Wellness fund, which is funded through student fees. As of Spring 2023, the group has distributed 4,700 fentanyl test strips, 402 Narcan kits and trained over 500 students in overdose prevention. HREP student staff table on Sproul plaza every week, offering peer to peer training and educational resources.

Despite the cCampus’ efforts, getting students informed remains an issue.

“Awareness and visibility is one of our greatest challenges being on a large campus” Program Coordinator for Collegiate Recovery Becca Gardner said. “We’re always seeking to partner with student groups and advocates.”
