  {" "}
  A lot of things happened in 2020: the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in the
  United States, the murder of George Floyd, the subsequent resurgence of the Black
  Lives Matter movement and the presidential election. It was also the year the nation
  saw the highest number of reported hate crimes — 8,263, to be exact — in nearly
  two decades, according to FBI data. Could the same be true for Berkeley?{" "}
</p>
<p>
  {" "}
  Using the FBI’s hate crime explorer, we visualized the total number of reported
  hate crimes within UC Berkeley and the surrounding city from 1995 to 2020.{" "}
</p>
<h3> Count of hate crimes in Berkeley and UC Berkeley, 1995-2020 </h3>
<HateLine />
<p>
  {" "}
  The number of hate crimes in both the city of Berkeley and campus were generally
  low except for some sharp peaks. The city saw more than 20 hate crimes in 2002,
  2003 and 2017, which closely followed the Sept. 11 attacks and the #MeToo movement.
  However, campus rates did not follow similar patterns despite efforts to increase
  reporting.{" "}
</p>
<p>
  Hate crime data collection was officially mandated by the{" "}
  <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2010/resources/hate-crime-2010-about-hate-crime">
    {" "}
    1990 Hate Crime Statistics Act
  </a>
  . The act required the U.S. attorney general to collect data on “crimes that manifest
  evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity,”
  according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting, or UCR, website. The attorney general
  then assigned “the responsibilities of developing the procedures for implementing,
  collecting, and managing hate crime data” to the director of the FBI, who in turn
  assigned it to the UCR program.{" "}
</p>
<p>
  In the same year Congress passed the Hate Crime Statistics Act, it also
  enacted the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime
  Statistics Act, otherwise known as the Clery Act.{" "}
  <a href="https://clerycenter.org/policy/the-clery-act/"> The Clery Act</a>{" "}
  requires all college campuses that rely on federal financial aid programs to
  keep track of and share information about crime on and near their campuses by
  publishing annual reports of crime and fire statistics.{" "}
</p>
<p>
  The first hate crime reporting campus website, stophate.berkeley.edu, was{" "}
  <a href="https://cejce.berkeley.edu/report-incident/hate-crimes-ending">
    {" "}
    created during the 1999-2000 academic year
  </a>{" "}
  by the Student Advocate’s Office. The Chancellor’s Taskforce on Hate & Bias
  took over the site in 2003, though reported campus rates were some of the
  lowest during that year. A possible explanation for low rates is that students
  may have chosen to report crimes directly to city authorities.
</p>
<p>
  The largest campus spike occurred in 2010 when UC Berkeley{" "}
  <a href="https://www.dailycal.org/2011/09/29/uc-berkeley-sees-rise-in-hate-crimes-in-2010/">
    {" "}
    stressed
  </a>{" "}
  the importance of reporting hate crimes. Increased visibility to a 2008
  federal policy change that expanded hate crime definitions to include
  hate-motivated vandalism could explain the increase in rates.{" "}
</p>
<p>
  {" "}
  On a larger scale, we also looked at state and national data. The number of hate
  crimes in California and within the United States follow a similar pattern, with
  racially motivated hate crimes being the largest subtype for both. Within California,
  however, a larger proportion of hate crimes is motivated by race or sexual orientation.{" "}
</p>
<p>
  The FBI{" "}
  <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/ucr/ucr-hate-crime-data-collection-guidelines-training-manual-02272015.pdf/view">
    {" "}
    defines a hate crime{" "}
  </a>{" "}
  as a traditional offense “motivated by the offender’s bias” rather than a
  separate, distinct crime. Lawmakers amended the Hate Crime Statistics Act in
  1994 to include disability-motivated hate crimes and again in 2009 to include
  gender and gender identity-motivated hate crimes and hate crimes “committed by
  or directed against juveniles.”{" "}
</p>
<p>
  The UCR program collects data on the biases outlined by the Hate Crime
  Statistics Act, which includes disability, gender, gender identity, race,
  religion or sexual orientation. The program also collects data on incidents
  where there is more than one victim involved and they represent different
  races or religions. Such incidents are categorized as “Anti-Multiple Races,
  Group” and “Anti-Multiple Religions, Group,” respectively.{" "}
</p>
<p>
  According to the UCR hate crime data collection guidelines and training
  manual, collecting hate crime data involves a{" "}
  <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/ucr/ucr-hate-crime-data-collection-guidelines-training-manual-02272015.pdf/view">
    “two-tier decision-making process”
  </a>
  :
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    The law enforcement officer who first responds to the alleged hate crime
    incident is responsible for determining whether there is any indication that
    the offender was motivated by bias.{" "}
  </li>
  <li>
    If the officer decides there is, they categorize the incident as a
    “suspected bias-motivated crime” and send the case file to a second officer,
    usually someone who is trained in hate crime matters or part of a special
    hate crimes unit.{" "}
  </li>
  <li>
    The second officer or unit is then responsible for reviewing the facts of
    the incident and making the final determination of whether a hate crime
    occurred. If they decide that the incident is a hate crime, the incident is
    reported to the UCR program as a “bias-motivated crime.”{" "}
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  {" "}
  One of the key components of this two-tiered decision-making process is the phrase
  “facts of the incident.” According to the UCR program, an incident can only be
  categorized as a hate crime if the offender(s) and victim(s) of the incident fit
  certain requirements. This includes, but is not limited to, the offender making
  “bias-related” verbal or written comments or gestures; the offender being a member
  of a hate group or causing similar hate crimes; or the offender and victim being
  different races, religions, disabilities, sexual orientations, ethnicities, genders
  and/or gender identities. Incidents that <a href="https://cejce.berkeley.edu/report-incident/what-hate-crime#hatecrime">
    {" "}
    qualify
  </a> as hate crimes include not only physical assault but also vandalism, “hate”
  graffiti or other visual representations of hate against a group.
</p>
<p>
  {" "}
  There are, however, caveats to these requirements. The FBI strongly recommends
  that officers and specialized hate crime units carefully assess what happened to
  ensure there isn't any feigned information. For example, the offender may have
  shouted a racial slur at the victim, even if they share the same race.{" "}
</p>
<p>
  In the case of UCPD, the department also has a system involving “multiple
  layers of review,” said Sgt. Jacob Westlie in an email. Officers receive
  reports of crime through calls and document them via in-person reporting.
  After conducting the preliminary investigation, filing the initial report and
  offering resources to victims, officers notify the on-duty sergeant. Sergeants
  monitor and respond to incoming reports while notifying the lieutenant, who
  then notifies the captain. Officers’ reports are checked by the sergeants, and
  any crimes requiring additional investigation are forwarded to the
  department’s Criminal Investigation Bureau.
</p>
<p>
  {" "}
  Notably, in 2008, the Berkeley Police Department reported “no hate crimes that
  met FBI data collection guidelines.” However, in 2010, Councilwoman Kriss Worthington{" "}
  <a href="https://www.cityofberkeley.info/uploadedFiles/Clerk/Level_3_-_City_Council/2010/10Oct/2010-10-19_Item_12_Support_Asahbir_Basi.pdf">
    {" "}
    wrote a support letter
  </a> addressed to a victim of an alleged hate crime. In the letter, she mentions
  an incident that occured in March 2008, in which “two gay men were assaulted by
  a large group of men for their sexual orientation.” And, according to BPD <a href="https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2008/08/07/berkeley-police-reports-6/">
    reports
  </a> from July 25, 2008, a man was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly
  weapon and committing a hate crime after allegedly yelling racial and gender-related
  slurs and throwing a bottle of juice at a female parking enforcement officer.{" "}
</p>
<p>
  {" "}
  “It is not safe to assume no hate crimes or hate incidents occurred just because
  none were reported,” Westlie said in the email.
</p>
<p>
  {" "}
  UCPD also reported zero hate crimes to the FBI in 1995, 1997, 1999 through 2002,
  2011 and 2018 through 2020. However, <a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2019/01/04/police-berkeley-man-charged-after-leaving-fake-bomb-with-anti-jewish-slurs-at-ucpd">
    crimes
  </a> targeted against specific groups happened on campus these years, and UCPD
  reported <a href="https://ucpd.berkeley.edu/complaints-made-2018-2020">
    complaints
  </a> related to discrimination based on race from 2018 to 2020.{" "}
</p>
<p>
  {" "}
  In 2017, The Daily Californian was one of 20 college newspapers ProPublica partnered
  with to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/what-we-found-in-three-years-of-documenting-hate-an-open-letter-to-our-partners">
    uncover
  </a> how a significant portion of hate crimes across the United States go unreported.
  When underreporting was raised as a concern, Westlie responded that UCPD is “aware
  that hate crimes are severely underreported.”
</p>
<p>
  {" "}
  The city of Berkeley has acknowledged hate crime underreporting. Last year, Berkeley’s
  Homeless Coalition <a href="https://www.cityofberkeley.info/Clerk/City_Council/2021/04_Apr/Documents/2021-04-20_Item_19_Recommendation_to_Incorporate.aspx">
    called
  </a> for the City Council to keep track of hate crimes against homeless people
  as a way to improve hate crime reporting and response.{" "}
</p>
<p>
  For survivors of hate crimes or incidents, UC Berkeley’s Centers for
  Educational Justice and Community Engagement, or CEJCE,{" "}
  <a href="https://cejce.berkeley.edu/report-incident/hate-crime-target-witness">
    recommends
  </a>{" "}
  that individuals prioritize safety, receive medical attention if necessary,
  document evidence of the incident, take care of themselves and most
  importantly, not blame themselves. CEJCE strongly recommends reporting the
  incident via the UC-wide hate incident reporting{" "}
  <a href="https://ucsystems.ethicspointvp.com/custom/ucs_ccc/default.asp">
    form
  </a>
  , even if individuals don’t choose to press charges. Other campus <a href="https://cejce.berkeley.edu/report-incident/hate-crimes-ocr">
    resources
  </a> current students include the Gender Equity Resource Center, ASUC Student Advocate
  Office and the Attorney for Students.{" "}
