<h3> Number of Crimes in City of Berkeley and UC Berkeley, 1995-2020 </h3>

<p> According to FBI data, 2020 saw the highest number of reported hate crimes in the U.S. in nearly two decades. In Berkeley, we wanted to see if local hate crime statistics reflected these national trends. Using the FBI’s hate crime explorer, we visualized the total number of reported hate crimes within campus and the city from 1995-2000. </p> 
<HateLine />
<p> The number of hate crimes in both the city of Berkeley and within the UC Berkeley campus were generally low except for some sharp peaks. City rates rose above 20 in 2002, 2003, and 2017, which coincides with counterrorism efforts post 9/11 and the Me Too movement. Interestingly, UC Berkeley rates did not follow similar patterns despite campus efforts to increase reporting. </p> 
<p>The first hate crime campus website, stophate.berkeley.edu, was created in 1999-2000 by the Student Advocate’s Office. The Chancellor’s Taskforce on Hate & Bias took over the site in 2003, though reported campus rates were some of the lowest at this time. A possible explanation for low rates is that students may have chosen to report crimes directly to authorities. </p> 
<p>The largest campus spike occurred in 2010, when UC Berkeley most emphasized the importance of reporting hate crimes. Increased visibility to a 2008 policy change that expanded hate crime definitions to include vandalism might explain the increase of reported rates. </p> 
<p>On a larger scale, we also looked at state and national data. The number of hate crimes in California and within the U.S. follow a similar pattern, with racially motivated hate crimes being the largest subtype for both. Within California, however, a larger proportion of hate crimes are motivated by race or sexual orientation.</p> 
<p>Hate crime reporting and data collection were officially mandated by the 1990 Hate Crime Statistics Act. The act required the U.S. Attorney General to collect data on “crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity,” according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) website. The Attorney General then assigned “the responsibilities of developing the procedures for implementing, collecting, and managing hate crime data” to the Director of the FBI, who in turn assigned it to the UCR program. </p> 
<p> In the same year Congress passed the Hate Crime Statistics Act, Congress also enacted the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, otherwise known as the Clery Act. The Clery Act requires all college campuses relying on federal financial aid programs to keep track of and share information about crime on and near their campuses by publishing annual reports of crime and fire statistics. </p> 
<p>The FBI defines a hate crime as a traditional offense “motivated by the offender’s bias” rather than a separate, distinct crime. Lawmakers amended the act in 1994 to include disability-motivated hate crimes, and again in 2009 to include gender and gender-identity-motivated hate crimes and hate crimes “committed by or directed against juveniles.” </p> 
<p>The UCR program collects data only on the biases “mandated by the Hate Crime Statistics Act,” which include disability, gender, gender identity, race, religion or sexual orientation. The program also collects data on incidents where more than one victim in an incident is a different race or religion, categorized as “Anti-Multiple Races, Group” and “Anti-Multiple Religions, Group” respectively. </p> 
<p>According to the UCR hate crime data collection guidelines and training manual, collecting hate crime data involves a “two-tier decision-making process”:</p>  
<ol>
<li>The law enforcement officer who first responds to the alleged hate crime incident is responsible for determining whether there is “any indication that the offender was motivated by bias.”</li> 
<li>If the officer decides there is, they categorize the incident as a “suspected bias-motivated crime” and send the case file to a second officer, usually a “person specially trained in hate crime matters,” or a special hate crimes unit. </li>
<li>The officer or unit is then responsible for reviewing the facts of the incident and making the “final determination of whether a hate crime has actually occurred.” If they decide that the incident is a hate crime, the incident is reported to the UCR program as a “bias-motivated crime.” </li>
</ol>
<p> One of the key components of this two-tiered decision-making process is the phrase “facts of the incident.” According to the FBI UCR program, an incident can only be categorized as a hate crime if the offender(s) and victim(s) of the incident fit certain requirements, including (but not limited to) the offender making “bias-related” verbal or written comments or gestures, the offender being a member of a hate group or causing similar hate crimes, or the offender and victim being “different races, religions, disabilities, sexual orientations, ethnicities, genders and/or gender identities.” Incidents that qualify as hate crimes include not only physical assault but also vandalism, “hate” graffiti or other visual representations of hate against a group.</p> 
<p> There are caveats to these requirements. The FBI strongly recommends that officers and specialized hate crime units carefully assess what happened during each incident to ensure there aren’t any “misleading” or “feigned” facts, such as the offender shouting a racial slur yet sharing the same race as the victim or students vandalizing their own school with anti-religious statements “in the hope they will be excused from attending class.” </p> 
<p> Notably, in 2008, the Berkeley Police Department reported “no hate crimes that met FBI data collection guidelines.” However, at least one hate crime still occurred that year. In 2010, in a support letter addressed to a hate crime victim, Councilwoman Kriss Worthington mentions an incident in March 2008 in which “two gay men were assaulted by a large group of men for their sexual orientation.” And, according to Berkeley police reports from July 25, 2008, a man was “arrested for alleged assault with a deadly weapon and committing a hate crime” after yelling racial and gender-related slurs and throwing a bottle of juice at a female parking enforcement officer. </p>
<p> UC Berkeley Police Department (UCPD) also reported no hate crimes to the FBI in 1995, 1997, 1999 through 2002, 2011, and 2018 through 2020. However, crimes were still reported during these years. In 2017, the Daily Californian was one of 20 college newspapers ProPublica partnered with to uncover how a significant portion of hate crimes across the U.S. go unreported. The Daily Californian has reached out to UCPD for comment on their process of determining which incidents count as hate crimes and reporting these numbers to the FBI. </p> 
<p> The city of Berkeley has acknowledged hate crime underreporting. Last year, the city of Berkeley’s Homeless Coalition called for the city council to keep track of hate crimes against persons experiencing homelessness as a way to improve hate crime reporting and response. </p> 
<p>For survivors of hate crimes or incidents, UC Berkeley’s Centers for Educational Justice and Community Engagement (CEJCE) recommends that individuals prioritize safety, receiving medical attention if necessary, documenting evidence of the incident, taking care of themselves and most importantly, not blaming themselves. CEJCE strongly recommends reporting the incident via the UC-wide hate incident reporting form even if individuals don’t choose to. Other on-campus resources current students can go to for support include the Gender Equity Resource Center, ASUC Student Advocate Office and Attorney for Students. </p>
