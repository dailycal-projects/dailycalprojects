Berkeley, CA, the birthplace of Peet’s Coffee, boasts the most coffee shops per capita in the United States, with one coffee business per 2,073 residents. For the nearly 46,000 students enrolled in UC Berkeley, this means that there are a plethora of coffee shops to visit nearby.

_The map above shows the coffee shops located within a mile of the UC Berkeley campus. Ratings are displayed to the nearest half-star and were sourced from Google Maps to order the ranking of coffee shops. The cost of coffee corresponds to the medium size, or generally 12 oz.; in establishments that only provide small and large options, the pricing is based on the small size, or 8 oz. Data come from the menus in each coffee shop as of Dec. 16._

The UC Berkeley campus offers a wide variety of selections ranging from Free Speech Movement Cafe in Moffitt Library to cafes located in other buildings, such as Kiklo (formerly Yali’s) in Stanley Hall. Coffee shops off of Berkeley’s main campus are centered around densely visited areas along Telegraph Avenue, Bancroft Way, Euclid Avenue and Shattuck Avenue.

_CHANGE The data comes from the physical menus displayed in each coffee shop. The baseline size of coffee used in our calculations was a 12oz (or the coffee shop's medium equivalent) coffee. In shops where there were no medium drinks offered, the average was taken between the small and large drinks._

Berkeley features a mix of coffee franchises and independent shops. The prices at chain establishments, such as Starbucks or Peet’s, differ based on their location. For example, the Peet’s located inside Brown’s on campus is on average 10 cents more expensive than the Peet’s on Telegraph.

When deciding which coffee shop to visit, college students face a variety of constraints such as the type of coffee available, accessibility and convenience.

“I come to Caffè Strada a couple times a week because it’s convenient,” said UC Berkeley student Ara Eghbali one afternoon at the Berkeley establishment located directly across from campus.

Some Berkeley cafe-frequenters noted an increase in prices at their favorite spots over the past few months.

“I was gone over the summer, but when I came back I think I’m paying a little more… I’m now paying $7 for a latte when I used to pay around $5, ” Eghbali said, speaking about coffee shops in Berkeley in general.

Some spots have been increasing their prices to adapt to shifts in the local economy.

Owner of Delah Coffee’s Berkeley location, Ahmed Alhomedi, explained that in addition to the elevated coffee bean market, espresso beans, which are roasted at a higher temperature for a longer period of time than coffee beans, “cost an arm and a leg.” Specialty drinks have a higher price due to the presence of organic, expensive ingredients such as cardamom and cinnamon, he added.

An espresso at Delah Coffee costs $4.25.

These fluctuations, however, are not uniform across all coffee shops. UC Berkeley student and Mind Coffee enthusiast Madison O’Kane shared that while coffee is still generally expensive in Berkeley, she has “not really noticed an increase in price.” Delah’s prices have stayed the same since their opening in early September, according to Alhomedi.

“We don’t plan to raise prices because we’re in it for the long run. Business is not just about making money,” Alhomedi said “We want students to think of the cafe as comfortable as home.”

While the price of coffee in Berkeley continues to be in flux, one thing remains constant: the city’s coffee shops remain an integral part of the UC Berkeley student experience and of the city as a whole.
