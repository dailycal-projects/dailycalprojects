In fall 2022, The Daily Californian introduced for the first time a source audit under the purview of the managing editor of race and equity, or MERE, DEI Committee chair and editor in chief. The purpose of this initiative was to trial an audit for the newspaper in a way that would allow for more awareness and transparency in sourcing.

Given that the source audit was a new introduction, its integration took time and changes in the auditing process. This included meeting with departments to discuss feedback on the audit and overall user accessibility. After implementation of the source audit from September to December 2022, a decision was made to trial a static audit of content from January to April 2023.

By having piloted both a source and static audit of content, I was then able to gauge demographic trends in the paper’s coverage. Furthermore, both forms of auditing allowed me to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the different types of audits as well as the feedback from staff regarding each one.

The following report details the structure, data and takeaways from these audits.

## Purpose of auditing

The purpose of gathering this information was to create an index of sources at The Daily Californian, so that the paper and reporters could determine which identities go underrepresented in editorial content. In doing so, the MERE, DEI Committee chair and DEI liaisons planned to work with each department to determine ways to improve outreach to a more diverse range of sources in order to better represent the Berkeley community. We also wanted to reinforce the value of championing historically marginalized voices in our coverage in a way that accurately represented different identities and intersectionalities of identities.

## Fall 2022 source audit structure

The source audit for fall 2022 was piloted with the idea of having individual departments enter data for sources from respective content. Given that the news department and projects pieces typically relied the most on source-based content, these two departments were the ones which utilized the audit.

This version of auditing sources also relied on an audit-as-you-go approach, meaning that writers were asked to enter data on sources as the relevant articles were published, Additionally, a script and source audit guide were made to help direct writers in how to ask sources questions that would help answer parts of the audit.

One of the primary benefits of this methodology was the ability to hear directly from sources how they identify. This allowed for accuracy in auditing as well as minimized the need to answer questions with “unknown.” However, sources were still able to skip questions or prefer not to disclose. They were also informed that all information would be anonymized, and the data would only be used for overall trend analysis.

A primary concern that came up with this format of auditing involved the comfortability of Daily Cal staff with asking more demographic-based questions. Although staffers were encouraged to use the audit despite its newness and learning curve, staff feedback ultimately revealed that staffers were resistant to audit usage.

For this reason, roundtable discussions were held between the MERE, DEI chair, EIC and news department to explore the option of alternative auditing formats.

## Spring 2023 static audit structure

The solution to source audit resistance led the MERE to conduct a static audit for the following spring 2023 semester.

Data for the static audit was gathered by the MERE from news story docs and a source registry. Information to answer each question on the audit also came from online research regarding the background of sources. For cases where an educated guess could not be made about any element of information on the source, a “prefer not to disclose” or “unknown” option was available. The option "other" was also included to account for information that does not fit into any of the categories included for each question.

Like the source audit, the static audit focused on news and projects pieces from a four-month time period. Each article audited had, on average, two to three sources. Repeat sources were also included to account for the frequency that one specific source may appear in the paper’s content.

In addition to recording data on the source, the MERE also recorded what type of article the source was cited in — including campus, city, state and national coverage.

_ Data for the fall 2022 and spring 2023 semesters come from 95 and 280 responses, respectively. For questions with multiple selection options, percent results indicate the proportion of students selecting each option._

## Highlights from fall 2022 source audit

Of the data collected, there were 57 campus-based sources, 30 city-based sources and 8 sources that can be grouped as “other” to account for less common articles focused on obituaries and state or national affairs. This totaled to a sample size of 95 sources.

#### Age

Overall, the age breakdown for the 95 respondents is as follows: 1.1% less than 18 years old, 21.1% ages 18 to 25, 40% ages 25 to 50, 21.1% ages 50 to 65 and 10.5% ages 65 and older. 6.3% of the sample preferred not to disclose.

For the campus-based pieces of the sample, 24.6% of respondents were 18 to 25 years old, 40.4% were 25 to 50 years old, 15.8% were 50 to 65 years old and 8.8% were 65 or older. For these pieces, 10.5% of respondents preferred not to disclose. Given that campus consists predominantly of students and faculty or campus administration, the prevalence of sources ages 25 to 50 years old suggests that there are more sources who are campus authority or faculty than students who would most likely occupy a younger demographic of 18 to 25 years old.

On the city side of the sample, 3.3% of sources were less than 18 years old, 20% were 18 to 25 years old, 46.7% were 25 to 50 years old, 26.7% were 50 to 65 years old and 3.3% were 65 years or older. This city breakdown suggests that sources predominantly come from older demographics, but do not tend to come from individuals older than 65 years old.

#### Gender

For the 95 respondents, the breakdown of pronouns was 55.8% he/him, 36.8% she/her, 5.3% they/them and 1.1% she/they. The remaining respondents preferred not to say their pronouns.

Of the sources that were included in the 57 campus-based pieces, 52.6% were he/him, 42.1% were she/her, 1.8% were they/them and 1.8% preferred not to disclose. For sources that were in the 30 city-based pieces, 56.7% were he/him, 30% were she/her and 13.3% were they/them or she/they. This means that of the 95 recorded respondents, men compromised more than half of the sources for both campus and city coverage.

#### Race and ethnicity

Of the 95 respondents, 43.2% were white, 16.8% were Latine or Hispanic, 13.7% were Asian or Asian American, 9.5% were Black, African or African American, 9.5% were mixed race, 1% were Middle Eastern and 6.3% preferred not to disclose.

For campus-based pieces, there were 40.4% white, 17.5% Latine or Hispanic, 14% Asian or Asian American, 10.5% Black, African or African American, 5.3% mixed race and 1.8% Middle Eastern respondents. 10.5% of sources for campus pieces did not disclose. In city-based pieces, 43.3% of sources were white, 20% of sources were Latine or Hispanic, 16.7% were mixed race, 10% were Asian or Asian American and 10% were Black, African or African American.

One major takeaway from this breakdown is the disparity between white sources and all other racial or ethnic backgrounds of sources for the campus and city pieces sampled. Additionally, besides any mixed-race respondents, both campus-based and city-based pieces from the sample did not include respondents who specifically identified as Indigenous or Native American.

## Highlights from spring 2023 static audit

The MERE was able to extract data from a greater sample size of 280 sources for the static audit. Of the 280 sources, there were 144 associated with campus sources, 110 with the city and 26 that fell under the “other” category that includes state and national affairs and obituaries.

As with the fall 2022 source audit, this static audit analysis focuses on the demographics broken down based on campus and city coverage.

#### Age

Of the 280 sources, the age ranges included 1.1% respondents younger than 18 years old, 18.9% ages 18 to 25, 51.8% ages 25 to 50, 8.2% ages 50 to 65, 8.6% older than 65 years old and 11.4% with unknown ages. This distribution reveals that more than half of all sources in this sample group were ages 25 to 50 years old.

For campus-specific pieces, sources had the following age distribution: 23.6% ages 18 to 25, 52.8% ages 25 to 50, 7.6% ages 50 to 65, 9% older than 65 years old and 6.9% with unknown ages.

Similar to the overall sample, the sources for campus coverage were predominantly 25 to 50 years old. This mirrors the majority representation found from the fall 2022 source audit as well. Based on this consistency, a trend can be noted of campus coverage largely relying on the sourcing of individuals older than the typical age of campus students, but younger than more elderly members of the community.

For the city side, 2.7% of sources were younger than 18 years old, 13.6% were 18 to 25 years old, 50.9% were 25 to 50 years old, 8.2% were 50 to 65 years old, 8.2% were older than 65 years old and 16.4% had unknown ages. Once again, this distribution reveals how most sourcing for city-based content remains within the age range of 25 to 50 years old as well.

#### Gender

For gender-based identification, 53.6% of sources identified as he/him, 37.9% as she/her and 5.4% as they/them, she/they or he/they. Of this overall sample, there were 3.2% of sources whose pronouns and gender could not be determined.

Broken down into campus coverage, 50% of sources used he/him pronouns, 43.1% used she/her and 6.9% used they/them, she/they or he/they. On the city side, 57.3% used he/him, 30% used she/her, 4.5% used they/them, she/they or he/they and 8.2% remained unknown.

For the overall, campus-based and city-based coverage, at least half or more of the sources identified as men. This reaffirms the data from the source audit that also saw a majority of sources in all three breakdowns being men.

#### Race and ethnicity

For race and ethnicity, the overall source distribution was as follows: 38.2% white, 12.1% Latine or Hispanic, 14.3% Asian or Asian American, 13.6% Black, African or African American, 2.5% Middle Eastern, 1.1% Indigenous or Native American and 2.1% mixed race. 17.9% of overall respondents’ racial and ethnic backgrounds were unknown.

The distribution for campus coverage is very similar to the overall sample, with 39.6% white respondents, 14.6% Latine or Hispanic, 13.9% Asian or Asian American, 12.5% Black, African or African American, 4.2% Middle Eastern, 2.1% Indigenous or Native American and 0.7% mixed race. There were 13.2% of sources whose race and ethnicity were unknown.

The city coverage had similar demographics. However, it notably lacked sources who were not mixed race but identified as Indigenous or Native American. This suggests an underrepresentation of this racial and ethnic group and its perspectives in content produced on the city of Berkeley at the paper.

## Primary takeaways: Data

For both the source and static audit, the respondents were predominantly white men in the age range of 25 to 50 years old. While reporters cannot control the diversity for certain sources — such as campus administrators or city government officials — that hold long-term positions, they can make decisions to feature community members and first-person accounts that bring awareness to groups typically underrepresented by journalism.

This would include bringing in more women and nonbinary campus and community members into sourcing. Additionally, since many UC Berkeley students fall within the age range of 18 to 25 years old, they should represent a greater proportion of sources for campus coverage. A final recommendation would be to solicit sources from racial and ethnic backgrounds that do not typically make it into articles. This especially includes Indigenous and Native American communities, which were largely absent from the samples of both the source and static audit.

## Primary takeaways: Methodology

In terms of methodology, the static audit seemed to be more effective for ensuring accurate representation of the amount of sources the paper engages with. However, this version of the audit did have more left unknown given there was no enforced requirement for reporters to collect information on the demographic background of sources.

If the static audit were to be implemented once more for the paper, it would benefit from including a training that instructs reporters to have questions regarding pronouns as standard practice. This would help minimize the likelihood of misidentifying sources. A similar practice could be integrated to ask for other details (such as age and race or ethnicity) that would help produce a more informative audit.

One downside that must be noted is the inability for the static audit to consider other facets of identity, such as disabilities, socioeconomic status, first-generation individuals, international individuals, student parents, reentry students and other identifications. For this reason, the audit works best when it is viewed as only a snippet of the greater conversations that must be had regarding coverage and community representation in the newsroom.
