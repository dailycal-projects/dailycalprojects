In fall 2022, former Editor in Chief Katherine Shok, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee chair Michael Temprano and I launched a source audit for The Daily Californian.

While collecting data to better understand the background of sources and content we produce, I reflected on the importance of also taking an introspective look at the demographics of the newspaper itself. The Daily Cal is privileged to have a staff committed to representing the Berkeley community, and having staffers from diverse backgrounds can help immensely in representation.

This goal proves especially pertinent as journalism and media at large have been and continue to be mostly homogenous when it comes to identity.

A 2022 survey from Pew Research Center confirmed this reality with 76% of surveyed journalists identifying as white, 8% Hispanic or Latine, 6% Black and 3% Asian. Furthermore, Forbes has noted that a vast majority of media outlets in the United States are owned by white billionaires.

Other issues arise with representation in media when it comes to gender as well. Although the Pew Research Center recorded a fairly even split between men and women in the newsroom, the 2022 survey indicated that sports beats are 83% men, government and politics beats are 60% men, and science and tech beats are 58% men. Alternatively, social issues and policy beats are 58% women, education and family beats are 63% women, and health beats are 64% women. So although the newsroom sees more than one gender, the nuances of its beats tell a different story.

Whatâ€™s fascinating about the data from this survey comes from the reality that 67% of respondents said their newsroom has enough gender diversity, and 32% said their organization has enough racial and ethnic diversity. Less than half of the respondents identified addressing issues around representation in their newsroom as a major priority.

How does this affect the way society designs, disseminates and digests the information overload that permeates the media? And how does a nationwide survey of journalists correspond to the operations of a student-run newsroom based in Berkeley, California?

These are questions that cannot be answered without holding a mirror to the people and minds of the Daily Cal. My job as managing editor of race and equity is to therefore look inside the newspaper with the intention of looking forward to a field of journalism more representative of the world we cover.

## Methodology

The internal audit includes 222 respondents from the Daily Cal, all from a pool of fall 2023 staffers. The identities of the respondents will not be disclosed publicly, and the questions asked of each person are all voluntary in order to ensure consensual and comfortable engagement. For this reason, some questions include an option for those who prefer not to disclose certain information.

The 222 respondents came from 18 different departments at the paper. The breakdown of respondents based on department is as follows: 20.3% news, 13.5% design, 8.6% photo, 8.1% sports, 8.1% arts and entertainment, 7.7% multimedia, 7.2% night, 7.2% social media, 6.8% the Weekender, 5.9% blog, 5% projects, 3.6% opinion, 1.8% upper management or DEI chair, 1.8% marketing, 1.4% development, 0.9% business operations, 0.5% special issues and 0.5% online and tech.
