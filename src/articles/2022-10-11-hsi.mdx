Making up over 40% of the state’s population, Latine and Hispanic people are California’s dominant ethnic group. Yet, the state’s flag public university does not match this demographic profile. Less than 25% of UC Berkeley’s undergraduate and graduate students identify as Hispanic or Latine, according to fall 2021 enrollment data.

An underrepresented population on campus, concerns exist over Latine and Hispanic student resource allotment, inclusion and belonging in the UC Berkeley community.
The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, or HACU, was established in 1986 to represent institutions of higher education with high Hispanic and Latine populations. Later in 1992, amendments to the Higher Education Act of 1965 formalized the term Hispanic-serving institution, or HSI.

To be designated a HSI, a not-for-profit institution’s full-time, or full-time equivalent, undergraduate population must be 25% Hispanic.

Today, 21 of 23 CSU campuses and 6 of 9 UC campuses with undergraduate education are HSIs. UC Berkeley, however, is not.

Co-chair of campus’s Hispanic Serving Institution Task Force and Berkeley School of Education Professor Kris Gutiérrez recognizes this. Gutiérrez does not usually respond to media requests, but made an exception for this Daily Californian report.

“One, it has to do with geography,” Gutiérrez said in an interview. “It's much easier if I'm in Riverside, which is already a community in which there's a large demographic there for students to come to the institution without having to travel.”

The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the demographic composition of several California counties in 2021. 51.6% of Riverside County’s population was Hispanic or Latine. Meanwhile, Alameda County’s population was estimated to be 22.4% Hispanic or Latine.

To Gutiérrez, this demographic shortfall, relative to the state’s Hispanic and Latine population, is also due to UC Berkeley’s status.

“It has to do with the elite status of that university, and what it has privileged in terms of maintaining its elite status,” Gutiérrez said. “Having parity with the state demographics has been an aspiration, but not a central aspiration historically.”

UC Berkeley undergraduate and Director of Student Retention at Hispanic Engineers and Scientists Alexander Parra shared a similar concern.

“It really goes back to what UC Berkeley views itself as, and that’s an elite, prestigious university,” Parra said in a separate interview. “So they actively resist anything that will in any way hurt that image.”

While UC Berkeley is not a HSI, campus is championing efforts towards educating more Hispanic and Latine students. In fall 2018, Chancellor Carol Christ unveiled plans to make UC Berkeley a HSI. At that point, only 17.5% of all UC Berkeley undergraduates identified as Hispanic or Latine.

Christ’s plans formed the Hispanic Serving Institution Task Force, composed of 27 members appointed by the chancellor. With Gutiérrez as co-chair, Director of Undergraduate Admissions Olufemi Ogundele and Director of Chicanx Latinx Student Development Lupe Gallegos-Diaz also occupy seats on the task force.

The task force’s efforts are varied. Structured by three distinct chronological phases, it has organized focused work groups pursuing HSI eligibility, campuswide communications and investments to better serve Latine and Chicane students.

While the COVID-19 pandemic <a href="https://www.dailycal.org/2020/06/25/fundamentally-redefine-campus-culture-uc-berkeley-works-toward-hispanic-serving-institution-status" target="_blank">delayed</a> many of the task force’s plans, campus is dedicated to its original plan; it will apply for HSI designation by 2027. Moreover, Gutiérrez was pleased with the progress of the first phase, which set out to compile recommendations for campus by the end of 2022.

With recommendations planned, the task force has embarked on the second phase and created two new committees: an implementation committee and a steering committee.

“You have a steering committee that’s still giving overarching, high-level guidance and then an implementation committee that’s really dedicated to [doing it and putting it together],” Gutiérrez said.

Aside from increasing the presence of Hispanic undergraduates on campus, HSI designation has its financial perks.

Just in fiscal year 2019, $124.4M in extra funding from the Department of Education was secured for designated HSIs. The National Science Foundation and the Department of Agriculture also dedicated $40M and $9.2M, respectively. In the 2019-2020 school year, 569 HSIs existed, making up only 18% of colleges and universities, according to Excelencia in Education.

If campus acquires this extra funding, Parra would like to see it distributed to the Raíces Recruitment and Retention Center, the Latinx Caucus, the ethnic studies program or organizations working to help UC Berkeley achieve an HSI designation.

“Will that happen? You know, probably not,” Parra said.

However, UC Berkeley is under no obligation to distribute the funds to any particular group, organization or effort, according to Gutiérrez. She does not see this as a fault of the funding, though.

“It's got to be used in a more systemic way, which I think is really good because that's where you can start addressing infrastructure stuff,” Gutiérrez said.

She imagined that the funds could support more student-facing services, promote sustainability and forward faculty development, among other things.

Furthermore, Gutiérrez made a distinction. “You may have the numbers, but you haven't yet gone through the transformational change to develop an HSI identity,” Gutiérrez added. She thinks the new funding could be used to that end.

However, the HSI designation has its complications. In 2021, California’s population was 40.2% Hispanic or Latine, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Its colleges only need to be 25% Hispanic to be HSIs.

_The line chart above visualizes the percent composition Hispanic or Latine students in four groups: UC Berkeley undergraduate students, UC Berkeley graduate students, UC Berkeley’s total undergraduate and graduate student enrollment and all California public schools._

_For UC Berkeley, the percent make-up of Hispanic and Latine students represents data from the fall of the associated year. For California public schools, the percent make-up of Hispanic and Latine students represents data from the academic year starting with that year._

_The data come from <a href="https://calanswers.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">CalAnswers</a> and the <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/ad/filesenr.asp" target="_blank">California Department of Education</a>._

<br />

Every year since 1984, California public schools have seen a percent increase in Hispanic or Latine students. Meanwhile, UC Berkeley’s Hispanic and Latine enrollment has ebbs and flows. Only since fall 2011 has the percentage of Hispanic and Latine undergraduates increased each fall.

Even with these recent increases, UC Berkeley’s enrollment of Hispanic and Latine undergraduates still pales in comparison to that of California’s public schools.

An even greater disparity exists among UC Berkeley’s graduate students. Making up over 50% of California public schools since the 2009-2010 school year, Hispanic and Latine students make up only 13.7% of UC Berkeley’s graduate enrollment.

Diversity shortfalls among graduate students are not beyond campus officials. In September 2019, Christ broadly addressed diversifying the graduate student community. In doing so, the Graduate Student Diversity Task Force was launched. According to its website, the task force works “to increase the enrollment of underrepresented, low socioeconomic status, and first-generation graduate students and to improve the campus experience and academic outcomes for underrepresented graduate students across all of our graduate programs.”

The Graduate Student Diversity Task Force aimed to address shortcomings in diversity as a whole – queer, disabled and first-generation students included, among others. However, Latine and Hispanic graduate enrollment did rise.

In fall 2020, Latine and Hispanic students composed 12.2% of graduate enrollment. In fall 2021, they made up 13.7%.

This 1.5% increase was the largest in Latine and Hispanic graduate students in over 30 years. History was made, but 13.7% is a far cry from UC Berkeley’s 22.4% Latine and Hispanic undergraduates. An even farther cry from California public schools’ demographics.

“California does not match that demographic,” Parra said. “We need to get closer to that 40%.”

Aside from statistics, Parra takes issue with campus’s approaches to provide resources for Latine and Hispanic students. In particular, he notes campus’s response to designating a space for the Latinx Student Resource Center, or LSRC.

In January 2021, the Queer Alliance Resource Center and the bridges Multicultural Resource Center were slated to move out of their spaces in the Martin Luther King Jr. Student Union. In turn, the ASUC Student Union Board of Directors heard a proposal to designate space for the LSRC in the building for five years.

During the ASUC Student Union Board of Directors’ January 15, 2021 meeting, a public commenter expressed that the center had already experienced difficulties finding a space. Another said the LSRC was committed to paying for maintenance costs.

Given recent increases in UC Berkeley’s Latine and Hispanic enrollment, former ASUC senator Nick Araujo said, “I am concerned that this fall as we’re coming back to campus, we will have the largest Latinx population on a campus that does not have space for them,” according to <a href="https://studentunion.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/01_15_21-ASUC-Student-Union-Board-of-Directors.pdf" target="_blank">minutes</a> from the meeting.

The board <a href="https://www.dailycal.org/2021/01/21/uc-berkeley-latinx-resource-center-voted-down-in-favor-of-event-space" target="_blank">voted</a> down the proposal in favor of converting the fourth floor into an event space to boost revenue from commercial spaces, which had been slashed 80% amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Over a year later, the LSRC was finally given a designated space this year. It now occupies suite #2 of Hearst Memorial Gymnasium–which is in the basement, according to Parra.

“Too often, they make it clear that they don’t really care about Latinx students here at Cal, whether it's giving us literally the basement of a building for the [LSRC], or the removal of funding from ethnic studies program,” Parra said.

However, Parra was unsure what campus could do to better serve Hispanic and Latine students. He also did not see a future where campus takes equal part in securing a more inclusive environment for various student groups.

“The formation of a lot of these centers and organizations and the ethnic studies program came out of literal violence,” Parra alleged.

Parra alluded to a 1999 campus <a href="https://www.dailycal.org/2017/05/30/archives-students-arrested-building-standoff-ethnic-studies-supporters-take-barrows-hall" target="_blank">protest</a> – when UCPD officers entered a 10-hour standoff with students protesting budget cuts to the ethnic studies program in the Social Sciences Building. Some protestors were held in chokeholds by police officers or sent to a hospital for injury; 43 were arrested.

Staying the cause, protestors refused to leave the building until then Provost Carol Christ committed to 10 demands. According to Daily Californian coverage, Christ agreed to three of the protestors’ ten demands at the time.

“That's why I don't think that the university will ever really be able to align itself with any of the various [organizations] on campus,” Parra continued.

Aside from Christ’s more recent moves to promote diversity on campus as chancellor, she does remember the 1999 protest.

“If I were who I am now, then I would’ve handled it differently,” Christ said in a 2017 <a href="https://www.dailycal.org/2017/05/30/carol-christ-charge-campus-police-used-chokeholds-dismantle-1999-protest" target="_blank">interview</a> with a Daily Californian reporter. “But that’s not how (life) works.”

Gutiérrez remains hopeful. In her view, UC Berkeley’s efforts to achieve a HSI designation send a new message.

“One of the exciting things for me about UC Berkeley and UCLA saying that they want to become HSIs is that now you have two of the most elite institutions in the country who recognize that increasing its numbers of Latinx students is not in tension with maintaining its excellence,” Gutiérrez said. “Those things were always held in tension.”
