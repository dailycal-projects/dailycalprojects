The eight rent-controlled units that once encompassed 1921 Walnut St. are now little more than a barren construction site.

The building was constructed in 1909, tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street and University Avenue. It housed generations of Berkeley residents, narrowly escaping the flames of the 1923 Berkeley fire and undergoing several name changes.

For some, 1921 Walnut St. invokes memories of impassioned protests and legal battles between UC Berkeley and the city. The property was purchased by campus in 2020 and subsequently demolished less than two years later to [build](https://www.dailycal.org/2022/02/04/level-playing-field-uc-berkeley-breaks-ground-on-anchor-house/) the Helen Diller Anchor House, a 244-unit, 772-bed housing project.

According to campus spokesperson Dan Mogulof, the university provided “comprehensive” relocation packages to the former 1921 Walnut St. tenants based partly on their household income.

Packages included assistance in finding alternate housing, rental assistance payments and reimbursement for moving expenses, Mogulof added. Tenants could also choose a lump sum payment — equal to the rental assistance — for purchasing a house instead.

Mogulof noted that the $82.6 million settlement between campus and the city did not change plans for the Anchor House.

“It was always the campus's hope and intention to reach individualized agreements regarding relocation benefits with every household at 1921 Walnut Street,” Mogulof said in an email. “That is exactly what happened.”

[As rents rise in Berkeley and Alameda County](https://dailycal-projects.netlify.app/2021-11-22-rent-shelter), Anchor House may provide some much-needed relief to campus's strained housing supply. Currently, UC Berkeley houses the lowest percentage of undergraduate and graduate students in the UC system, but Anchor House will fulfill [9%](https://www.dailycal.org/2022/02/04/level-playing-field-uc-berkeley-breaks-ground-on-anchor-house/) of campus's housing goals for the next decade.

Despite this, Anchor House did not come to fruition without some detriment to the tenants of 1921 Walnut St. While none of the former residents were available for comment, tenant testimonials made prior to the vacating of the building are available at the [Save 1921 Walnut website](https://www.save1921walnut.org/open-letter-june-16-2021).

“The tenants at 1921 Walnut St. will be forever grateful to the Berkeley community that stood with us and fought with us,” Logusch said in a previous Daily Californian [article](https://www.dailycal.org/2022/02/04/level-playing-field-uc-berkeley-breaks-ground-on-anchor-house/).
