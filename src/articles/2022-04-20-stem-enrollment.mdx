Historically, people have considered the humanities to be insulated from STEM. Students and faculty alike believe the two classes of subjects have different skill sets, methodologies and guiding principles. 

But some question if the two are truly discrete; is there room for overlap between the two contrasting schools of thought?

## Diving into the data

Although people hold both STEM and humanities degrees from UC Berkeley in high esteem, campus enrollment data tells a slightly different story. According to campus's Our Berkeley dashboard, the 10 largest majors over the past decade have been heavily skewed towards STEM subjects.

During the 2012-13 academic year, four of the top 10 majors on campus fell under the humanities. Political science, for example, ranked as the second-most popular major with 937 declared students. At the same time, campus's fledgling computer science program in the College of Letters and Sciences had only 318 declared majors.

Nine years later, the number of declared political science majors has remained roughly the same. Enrollment in the computer science program skyrocketed, however, with more than 1,700 students joining the program.

Similar trends can be seen in other humanities and STEM majors, despite an overall increase in undergraduate admissions. 

Over the same nine-year period, the number of English, rhetoric, anthropology and history majors fell by almost 50% while majors such as data science or molecular and cell biology went from being nonexistent to garnering more than 1,000 students.

## 'Indispensable lenses': Faculty discuss importance of humanities
 
While the numbers tell one story, campus lecturers and professors offer a different perspective on the roles of STEM and the humanities.

For Hannah Zeavin, a lecturer in campus's English and history departments, the humanities may be key to informing decisions made in traditionally STEM fields. 

“Humanities and social science programs offer indispensable lenses for students working in STEM,” Zeavin said. “The challenges facing scientists — including health disparities and UX design — can be united by how they would be better addressed by taking the humanities more seriously.”

While there are issues of decreasing enrollment in some humanities courses, Zeavin said there is growing interest in working in fields that unite different disciplines in “productive intersections.” 

Cathryn Carson, professor and chair of campus's history department, added there was a “groundswell of interest” that prompted the creation of one such intersection: the science and technology studies minor. 

The minor, which falls under campus's Center for Science, Technology, Medicine and Society, aims to provide “critical apertures” to contemporary issues ranging from systemic racism in health care to ethical issues in biotechnology, according to Zeavin. 

Zeavin noted science and technology studies can bring together students from various disciplines to “detangle” complex socioethical systems and prompt productive debates. 

“Berkeley has been a leader in the world on thinking through these problems, and there are many spaces for undergraduates to get involved,” Zeavin said. “Seeing engineering students and data science students together, they will complement each other strongly. It's not an ‘either-or' situation.”

## 'Shaped by STEM': Avoiding the identity crisis

Carson echoed Zeavin's sentiments on what the future of STEM and the humanities may look like. Instead of viewing the two as completely separate disciplines, Carson said they “mutually shape each other.”
 
Using data science as an example, Carson said the discipline needs the perspectives and approaches of the humanities to consider its impacts on people. According to Carson, each aspect of STEM has some implication for human beings that require a more critical lens to address responsibly.

“Data science considers how human beings find themselves reflected or shaped in the data,” Carson said. “To examine structures in race and class, we have to consult the humanities. ”

Carson added the humanities bring a wealth of experience and potential answers to “questions of humanity and existence.

In other words, according to Carson, human beings are both “shaped by STEM and shape STEM.” Beyond classes, Carson pointed to an increased emphasis on ethics in STEM disciplines and highlighted a recent ASUC resolution that called for more ethics courses in these majors.

Despite increasing overlap between humanities and STEM thought processes, Carson emphasized the power humanistic methods had without the incorporation of STEM techniques. 

Assistant professor of practice in the School of Information Daniel Aranki agreed, noting the importance of preserving each discipline's “core identity,” while still benefiting from techniques from different fields. 

“Just as the study of ethics is proving fundamental for engineers and data scientists, some STEM methods can benefit humanities and social sciences,” Aranki said in an email. “The idea is not for everyone to be an expert in STEM methods, but rather to expand their skill set to include some tools that could help them in their own study.”
