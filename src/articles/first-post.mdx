In March 2020, UC Berkeley implemented a universal pass/no pass, or P/NP, policy for the semester,
setting a campus precedent for an adjusted grading system during remote schooling. Adjustments were
extended through fall 2020 and spring 2021, with various differences between colleges. Despite the
worsening pandemic, grading policies for summer 2020 and part of fall 2020 continued as usual until
campus administrators adjusted to student concerns.

The bar graph shows the number of letter grades requested by students before and during the pandemic.
In spring 2020, during universal P/NP, the number of requested letter grades was half of the usual
amount. The distribution of all grades in fall 2020 was more similar to that of prior semesters, but
the number of requested letter grades still fell short. A possible explanation for this result is that
P/NP policies were mostly undetermined until late fall, giving students less time to decide between grade
options. Another explanation could be that students had become used to remote learning and felt more
comfortable taking their classes for a letter grade. The Rausser College of Natural Resources was the
only college where the number of letter grades surpassed all prior numbers from spring 2019 to spring 2020.
