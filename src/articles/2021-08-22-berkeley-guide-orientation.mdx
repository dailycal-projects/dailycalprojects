## Best places to eat

### Coffee shops

#### Free Speech Movement Cafe

This iconic cafe is a staple to campus life — an ideal location to grab a snack between classes, study for a midterm or catch up with friends, all while paying homage to the movement that helped define UC Berkeley’s culture and legacy.

#### Yali’s Cafe

With three campus locations, Yali’s is a go-to stop to get some homework done in between classes. If you’re feeling hungry, get one of their sandwiches, or keep it simple with just a coffee. Regardless of what you choose, you won’t regret it.

#### Caffe Strada

Strada is a fan favorite, frequented by students for their crumbly scones, massive cookies and most importantly, the sunny outdoor seating area that gives you a sense of warmth and community.

#### Cafenated Coffee Company

Although farther from campus, Cafenated Coffee Company is a North Side gem. Its lovely green outdoor seating area is filled with colorful tables and plants — the perfect place to study, read, relax or use the aesthetic background to take some Instagram pictures.

### Lunch

#### Mezzo

Mezzo is usually a busy spot during the day and for good reason — with breakfast burritos to die for and giant sandwiches built with the freshest ingredients, you simply must stop by for a late breakfast or early lunch. Odds are good your leftovers will keep you fed for a couple of days.

#### Sliver

At this Berkeley staple with outposts located conveniently both on Telegraph and Shattuck, you can get a slice and a sliver of the pizza of the day and enjoy with their delicious cilantro dipping sauce.

#### Tacos Sinaloa

Enjoy affordable tacos, burritos and bowls at this popular Mexican joint.

#### Sweetgreen

Try Sweetgreen’s delicious, fresh bowls and salads if you’re in the mood for a healthier meal. Classics like the kale caesar and the harvest bowl never disappoint, but if you’re feeling extra adventurous you can opt for an equally tasty seasonal offering.

If the walls of your dorm or apartment are looking somewhat bare, Moe’s sells great posters to spice them up.

### Hangout spots

#### Memorial Glade

You can’t go wrong with this classic spot for a mid-day picnic with friends or solo unwinding time. Hang up a hammock, play some frisbee, work out, read or paint with a beautiful view of the Campanile.

#### Campanile

Though it has yet to reopen, in just a few short weeks you will be able to ride to the top of our campus’s iconic landmark for an unparalleled view of the city and bay.
